    <p>Follow this blondie <a href='https://theviewfromgreatisland.com/strawberry-lemon-blondies-recipe/'>recipe</a> for the perfect summer treat. Jammy pockets of strawberry pair nicely with the bright, tangy lemon accent.
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <b>Blondies:</b>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup unsalted butter
        <li>3/4 cup granulated sugar
        <li>1 large egg
        <li>1/4 cup fresh lemon juice
        <li>2 1/4 cup all-purpose flour
        <li>1/2 tsp baking powder
        <li>1/2 tsp salt
        <li>a cup diced fresh strawberries
        </ul>
    <b>Glaze:</b>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup sifted powdered sugar
        <li>1 tbs strawberry pur√©e
        <li>1 tbs (approx.) lemon juice
        </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 350F
            <li>Line a 9 inch square baking pan with parchment paper with long edges. This will help you lift out the blondies for easy glazing and slicing later.
            <li>Cream the butter and sugar until fluffy. Beat in the egg.
            <li>When the egg is fully incorporated, beat in the lemon juice. The lemon juice will probably not completely incorporate at this point, that's ok.
            <li>Whisk together the flour, baking powder, and salt, and add to the wet ingredients, mixing until no more dry flour is present.
            <li>Gently fold in the diced strawberries. Spread the mixture into your pan and spread out as evenly as possible. The dough is thick, so take your time.
            <li>Bake for 30-35 minutes, just until starting to turn golden around the edges and the center is set. A toothpick inserted in the center will be moist but not wet. Don't over-bake these, or they will dry out. Let cool on a rack.
            <li>Trim the strawberries for the glaze and puree in a small food processor. Strain the puree through a small strainer to get 1 Tbsp of puree. Whisk together the sugar, puree, and lemon juice until no lumps remain. If your glaze is too thin, add a touch more sugar. If it's too thick, add more lemon juice.
            <li>Spread the glaze over the cooled blondies. Let the glaze set before slicing.
            </ol>
